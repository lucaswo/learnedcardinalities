Enhanced Query Featurization for Cardinality Estimation
====

Updated implementation of multi-set convolutional networks (MSCN) to include and test other featurizations [[1]](#references).

## Requirements

  * PyTorch 1.0
  * Python 3.7

## Usage

```python3 train.py --help```

Example usage:

```python3 train.py synthetic```

To use a different featurization:

```python3 train.py --feat range --queries 100000 --epochs 100 synthetic```

You can find the different featurizations in [`mscn\util.py`](https://github.com/lucaswo/queryfeaturizations/blob/master/mscn/util.py).
